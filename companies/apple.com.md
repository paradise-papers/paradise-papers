The ICIJ says the leaked documents expose the tax engineering of more than 100 multinational corporations, including Apple, Nike and Botox-maker Allergan.

Apple chose Jersey as a new haven to continue avoiding billions in taxes after a 2013 crackdown on its controversial tax practices in the Republic of Ireland.

Apple moved the firm holding most of its huge untaxed offshore cash reserve to the Channel Island, allowing it to avoid billions of tax around the world – but has insisted the secretive new structure had not cut its taxes.

In an email obtained by the ICIJ, an Apple lawyer asked Appleby whether moving to one of six tax havens would allow the tech firm’s Irish subsidiary to “conduct management activities ... without being subject to taxation in these jurisdictions.”

The European Commission recently ordered Apple to pay €13bn (£11.5bn) in back taxes over a “sweetheart” deal with the Irish government that allowed it to pay almost no tax on its sales in Europe and some other global markets.

Until 2014, Apple had been exploiting a loophole in tax laws in the US and the Republic of Ireland known as the “double Irish”.

This allowed Apple to funnel all its sales outside of the Americas – currently about 55 per cent of its revenue – through Irish subsidiaries that incurred hardly any tax.
